If there is not a consensus as to which neighborhood has the highest ratings and the most reviews, the information will be analyzed to determine if a certain neighborhood can be determined as a \"better\" option. If not, choose the neighborhood with the higher ratings, or more visitors, depending on the style of restaurant to be opened. The style of restaurant will not be specified so that is as far as this analysis will take us.
